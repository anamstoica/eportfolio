        <p>
          This module provides an in-depth, practice-oriented introduction to machine learning, with a strong emphasis on real-world data analytics applications. It is designed to develop both conceptual understanding and practical proficiency, beginning with the mathematical foundations essential to the field and progressing through a structured exploration of core learning models and algorithmic paradigms. 
            
          The curriculum covers a broad range of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, integrating theoretical insights with hands-on implementation using contemporary software tools and datasets. Practical case studies are used to bridge the gap between theory and application, enabling the construction and evaluation of full machine learning pipelines. 
        
          Advanced topics such as model interpretability, performance evaluation, and deployment strategies are introduced in the context of current industry and research practices. The module also considers ethical, legal, and societal implications, highlighting the importance of responsible innovation in the development and application of machine learning systems.

          Legal and Ethical Views on ANN Applications
        </h4>
        <p>
          As mentioned in my initial post, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed how we approach various aspects of life, including communication, writing, research, and decision-making. Recent progress has been powered by transformer architectures, rapidly emerging as leaders over previous deep learning approaches like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (Sajun, Sankalpa and Zualkernan, 2024). Examples include LLMs like BERT and GPT-4, models that pushed the boundaries of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
        </p>

        <p>
          GPT-4 is a powerful tool, passing both the Turing test (Jones and Bergen, 2025) and the BAR exam (Daniel Martin Katz et al., 2024) with great performance. However, uncertainty remains a major concern. Despite their strengths, LLMs often generate false or nonsensical information, a process called hallucination (Liu et al., 2024). To address this, Zhang et al. (2025) applied a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method, feeding the model with real examples to fill in the gaps and prevent it from falsifying code or generating confusion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another issue raised in the initial post, and by my peers, is bias. LLMs were found to reflect societal biases, propagating issues like gender and racial stereotypes (Zack et al. 2024). This aspect, fueled by widespread use, highlights the urgent need for more accountability and regulation in model training and retroactive error correction.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regardless of NLP's success, limitations persist. Trying to replicate traits such as empathy and common sense remains difficult, although improvements are underway (Rasool et al., 2025). Ethical challenges also remain: overreliance in writing may undermine learning and academic integrity (Perkins et al. 2023), while applications in business raise questions about data privacy (Li et al. 2025).
        </p>

        <p>
          Moving forward, the AI implementation process must be responsible, including tracing a solid legal framework, but the most important aspect to ensure smooth progression is combining human oversight with machine support. It is essential to mitigate risks to harness AI's full potential across not only text, but only vision and other applications.
