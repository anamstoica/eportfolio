          The objective of the induction module is to acquaint students with a
          diverse range of digital resources, including but not limited to KOL,
          University of Essex Online, and the Virtual Learning Environment
          (VLE), Moodle. In addition, this module provides comprehensive support
          pertaining to online learning and available resources, while also
          familiarising students with the principles of critical thinking and
          reflective learning. These foundational skills are essential for
          success in subsequent modules, particularly those related to academic
          writing and research proficiency.
