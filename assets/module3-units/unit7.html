            Perceptron Activities
          </h4>
        <p>
          This unitâ€™s activity consisted of playing around with the concept of perceptrons and experimenting with its implementation in Python. Based on some Jupyter Notebooks notebooks, I was able to put notions to test by simply changing variables in a code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perceptrons are a rudimentary type of Neural Network (NN). It works with two variables: inputs and weights. In this context, weighting means scaling the importance of each input. With these two, a weighted sum is calculated, which in turn is passed through an activation function to give a binary result. The activation function used in the notebook is a step function and its outcome is either 1, if the weighted sum is equal or greater than 1, or 0, if the weighted sum is negative. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I played around with values to get the step function to return 1:
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code>
            inputs = np.array([0.1, 3])
            weights = np.array([0.6, 0.8])
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          By changing the weights to include a negative number, the step function does not activate and it returns 0:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            weights = [-1, 0.1]
          </code>
        </pre>
