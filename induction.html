        <h2 class="major">Induction Computing</h2>
        <p>
          The objective of the induction module is to acquaint students with a
          diverse range of digital resources, including but not limited to KOL,
          University of Essex Online, and the Virtual Learning Environment
          (VLE), Moodle. In addition, this module provides comprehensive support
          pertaining to online learning and available resources, while also
          familiarising students with the principles of critical thinking and
          reflective learning. These foundational skills are essential for
          success in subsequent modules, particularly those related to academic
          writing and research proficiency.

          The use of ePortfolios in a postgraduate degree programme
        </h4>
        <p>
          Working as a Senior Product Designer at GAN Integrity, I help global
          organisations elevate business ethics through the design and
          development of a complex Integrity SaaS Platform. My responsibilities
          include but are not limited to product strategy, concept development,
          user interface and experience design, and recently engaging with
          front-end web technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to effectively showcase academic achievements, skills, and
          experiences in a comprehensive and organized manner (Lorenzo &
          Ittelson, 2005), an e-portfolio is a powerful weapon that I am eager
          to develop as a means to demonstrate growth and accomplishments to a
          wider audience, such as potential employers or academic institutions
          (Barrett, 2004). This hypothesis is further reinforced by a 2017 study
          (Ring, Waugaman and Brackett, 2017), where more than 80% of inquired
          employers found portfolios valuable for screening and hiring the right
          people. Further reading leads me to conclude that digital portfolios
          provide an avenue for developing a strong professional identity.
        </p>

        <p>
          My postgraduate e-portfolio would inherently be much more ambiguous
          and advanced compared to that of an undergraduate (Jaekel, 2020),
          demonstrating mastery within research, analysis, presentations,
          teamwork, leadership and concrete practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am familiar with creating a digital portfolio due to the nature of
          my work, however, a challenging aspect will be navigating the
          political process of curating and updating the content, as not all
          work will be deemed ‘suitable enough’ to be displayed. Regular
          reflection is needed to grasp insights into learning and professional
          experiences (Barrett, 2004), which is an exciting challenge to take
          on.
